# fullcontrol leadscrew
A leadscrew generator written in python using fullcontrol.xyz

Its something that i made about a year ago, found it again today and decided to publish the code.

[An example gcode](https://github.com/theahadev/fullcontrol-leadscrew/blob/main/README.md)

I don't know if it will run on local, works on Google Collab.
There's a lot of leftover code and random stuff that i don't remember what's it for, most of them are test codes.

It runs as it is, if you wanna use it for anything real or tweak it its better to just rewrite most of it and keeping only the math part.

[Reddit post about it](https://www.reddit.com/r/FullControl/comments/1ism75v/my_first_creation_with_fullcontrol/)
